Documentation: Often less documentation, which can be a drawback for regulatory or complex projects.

Waterfall:

Advantages:

Structured Approach: Clear, linear phases make it easy to understand and manage.

Documentation: Extensive documentation ensures clarity and traceability.

Predictability: Easier to estimate timelines and budgets due to fixed requirements.

Disadvantages:

Inflexibility: Difficult to accommodate changes once the project has started.

Late Testing: Testing occurs at the end, which can lead to the discovery of major issues late in the process.

Customer Feedback: Limited customer involvement until the final product is delivered.

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile Beneficial:

Projects with Uncertain Requirements: Startups developing a new app where features may evolve based on user feedback.

Fast-Paced Industries: Tech companies needing rapid releases to stay competitive.

Example: A social media platform continuously updating features based on user trends.

Waterfall Beneficial:

Projects with Fixed Requirements: Government contracts with strict compliance and documentation needs.

Large-Scale Infrastructure: Building a bridge where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Example: Developing a banking system with stringent regulatory requirements.

5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods:

Automated Testing: Implement automated tests to catch regressions and ensure code quality.

Code Reviews: Regular peer reviews to maintain coding standards and share knowledge.

Continuous Integration: Integrate code changes frequently to detect issues early.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve end-users in testing to ensure the product meets their needs.

Performance Testing: Ensure the software performs well under expected load conditions.

Importance:

User Satisfaction: High-quality software meets user expectations, leading to higher satisfaction.

Reduced Costs: Early detection of defects reduces the cost of fixes.

Reputation: Quality products enhance the company's reputation and credibility.

Compliance: Ensures the software meets regulatory and industry standards.
